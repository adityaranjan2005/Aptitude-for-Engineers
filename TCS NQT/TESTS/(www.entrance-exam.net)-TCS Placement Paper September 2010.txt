Q. 11. Alice and Bob play the following coins-on-a-stack game. 100 coins are stacked one above the other. One of them is a special (gold) coin and the rest are ordinary coins. The goal is to bring the gold coin to the top by repeatedly moving the topmost coin to another position in the stack.
Alice starts and the players take turns. A turn consists of moving the coin on the top to a position i below the top coin (0 = i = 100). We will call this an i-move (thus a 0-move implies doing nothing). The proviso is that an i-move cannot be repeated; for example once a player makes a 2-move, on subsequent turns neither player can make a 2-move.
If the gold coin happens to be on top when it’s a player’s turn then the player wins the game.

A. Alice has no winning strategy.
B. Initially, the gold coins the third coin from the top. Then
C. In order to win, Alice’s first move should be a 0-move.
D. In order to win, Alice’s first move should be a 1-move.

Ans. D

Q 21.  Horse started to chase dog as it relieved stable two hrs ago. And horse started to ran with average speed 22km/hr, horse crossed 10 mts road and two small pounds with depth 3m, and it crossed two small street with 200 mts length. After traveling 6 hrs, 2hrs after sunset it got dog. compute the speed of dog?

Ans. As we have speed and travel time of horse, we can get distance traveled by it.
Note: Hence d = 22*6 = 132km,
Exactly this 132km was traveled by dog in 8 hours (as it started two hours earlier).
Hence speed of dog = 132/8 = 16.5km/hr
Ans. 16.5km/hr.

Q. 31. A man has to get air-mail. He starts to go to airport on his motorbike. Plane comes early and the mail is sent by a horse-cart. The man meets the cart in the middle after half an hour. He takes the mail and returns back, by doing so, he saves twenty minutes. How early did the plane arrive?

Ans:10min:::assume  he started at 1:00,so at 1:30 he met cart. He returned home at 2:00.so it took him 1 hour for the total jorney.by doing this he saved 20 min.so the actual time if the plane is not late is 1 hour and 20 min.so the actual time of plane is at 1:40.The cart travelled a time of 10 min before it met him.so the plane is 10 min early.

Q. 32.  2 trees are there. One grows at 3/5 of the other. In 4 years total growth of the trees is 8 ft. what growth will smaller tree have in 2 years.

Sol) THE BIG TREE GROWS 8FT IN 4 YEARS=>THE BIG TREE  GROWS 4FT IN 2 YEARS.WHEN WE DIVIDE 4FT/5=.8*3=>2.4

ans: 1.5 mt 4 (x+(3/5)x)=88x/5=2x=5/4 after 2 years x=(3/5)*(5/4)*2 =1.5

Q. 33. There is a six digit code. Its first two digits, multiplied by 3 gives all ones. And the next two digits multiplied by 6 give all twos. Remaining two digits multiplied by 9 gives all threes. Then what is the code?

sol) Assume the digit xx xx xx (six digits)
First Two digit       xx * 3=111
                      xx=111/3=37
( first two digits of 1 is not divisible by 3   so we can use 111)
Second Two digit xx*6=222
                 xx=222/6=37
( first two digits of 2 is not divisible by 6   so we can use 222)
Thrid Two digit    xx*9=333
                   xx=333/9=37
( first two digits of 3 is not divisible by 9   so we can use 333)

Q. 34. There are 4 balls and 4 boxes of colours yellow, pink, red and green. Red ball is in a box whose colour is same as that of the ball in a yellow box. Red box has green ball. In which box you find the yellow ball?

Ans is green...

Sol) Yellow box can have either of pink/yellow balls.
if we put a yellow ball in "yellow" box then it wud imply that "yellow" is also the colour of the box which has the red ball(becoz acordin 2 d question,d box of the red ball n the ball in the yellow box have same colour)
thus this possibility is ruled out...
therefore the ball in yellow box must be pink,hence the colour of box containin red ball is also pink....
=>the box colour left out is "green",,,which is alloted to the only box left,,,the one which has yellow ball..

Q. 35. A bag contains 20 yellow balls, 10 green balls, 5 white balls, 8 black balls, and 1 red ball. How many minimum balls one should pick out so that to make sure the he gets at least 2 balls of same color.

Ans:he should pick 6 ball totally.

Sol) Suppose he picks 5 balls of all different colours then  when he picks up the sixth one, it must match  any on of the previously drawn ball colour.
thus he must pick 6 balls

Q. 36. What is the number of zeros at the end of the product of the numbers from 1 to 100

Sol) For every 5 in unit palce one zero is added Ch eta naS
so between 1 to 100 there are 10 nos like 5,15,25,..,95 which has 5 in unit place.
Similarly for every no divisible by 10 one zero is added in the answer so between 1 to 100  11 zeros are added
for 25,50,75 3 extra zeros are added
so total no of zeros are 10+11+3=24

Q. 37. 10 Digit number has its first digit equals to the numbers of 1's, second digit equals to the numbers of 2's, 3rd digit equals to the numbers of 3's .4th equals number of 4's..till 9th digit equals to the numbers of 9's and 10th digit equals to the number of 0's. what is the number?.(6marks)

Ans:2100010006

2---shows that two 1's in the ans
1---shows that one 2 in ans
0---shows no 3 in the ans
0---shows no 4 in the ans
0---shows no 5 in the ans
1---shows one 6 in the ans
0---shows no 7 in the ans
0---shows no 8 in the ans
0---shows no 9 in the ans
6---shows six 0's in the ans

Q. 38 A and B are shooters and having their exam. A and B fall short of 10 and 2 shots respectively to the qualifying mark. If each of them fired atleast one shot and even by adding their total score together, they fall short of the qualifying mark, what is the qualifying mark?

Ans is 11

coz each had atleast 1 shot done so 10 + 1 = 11
n 9 + 2 = 11
so d ans is 11

Q. 39 Gavaskar average in first 50 innings was 50. After the 51st innings his average was 51 how many runs he made in the 51st innings

Ans) first 50 ings.- run= 50*50=2500
51st ings.- avg 51. so total run =51*51=2601.
so run scored in that ings=2601-2500=101 runs.

Q. 40. Anand finishes a work in 7 days, Bittu finishes the same job in 8 days and Chandu in 6 days. They take turns to finish the work. Anand on the first day, Bittu on the second and Chandu on the third day and then Anand again and so on. On which day will the work get over?

a) 3rd 
b) 6th 
c) 9th 
d) 7th

Ans is d) 7th day

Sol) In d 1st day Anand does 1/7th of total work
similarly,
Bithu does 1/8th work in d 2nd day
hence at d end of 3 days, work done = 1/7+1/8+1/6=73/168
remaining work = (168-73)/168 = 95/168
again after 6 days of work, remaining work is = (95-73)/168 = 22/168
and hence Anand completes the work on 7th day.(hope u understood.)
